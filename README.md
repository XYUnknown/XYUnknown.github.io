Greetings, it is quite unexpected for me that you visit this personal page. This is X.Y. A pair of representation of unknown numbers in mathematics but a proven exsiting creature. A pair of chromosomes indicating the biological male gender but actually a female. This creature Likes eating sweets, reading, watching anime and drawing (but being bad at drawing). Currently she locates at Edinburgh and doing research in computers. Maybe you have already might this creature or will meet this creature at somewhere on the earth. Have a nice day ^w^
