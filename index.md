Greetings, it is quite unexpected for me that you visit this personal page. This is X.Y. A pair of representation of unknown numbers in mathematics but a proven exsiting creature. A pair of chromosomes indicating the biological male gender but actually a female. I like eating sweets, reading, watching anime and drawing (but being bad at drawing). Currently I locate at Edinburgh and doing research in computers. Maybe you have already met me or will meet me at somewhere on the earth in the future. Have a nice day ^w^
